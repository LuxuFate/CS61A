# CS61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

The purpose of CS61A is to teach you the core concepts of computer science. CS61A is not about learning a particular programming language, though the course does introduce the Python programming language and uses it, along with a little Scheme and SQL, to teach programming concepts. This course concentrates on the idea of abstraction and using this idea to solve problems. The course considers a series of techniques for controlling program complexity, such as functional programming, data abstraction, and object-oriented programming.

CS 61A primarily uses the Python 3 programming language. Python is a popular language in both industry and academia. It is also particularly well-suited to the task of exploring the topics taught in this course. It is an open-source language developed by a large volunteer community that prides itself on the diversity of its contributors. We will also use two other languages in the latter half of the course: the Scheme programming language and the Structured Query Language (SQL).

Mastery of a particular programming language is a very useful side effect of CS 61A. However, our goal is not to dictate what language you use in your future endeavors. Instead, our hope is that once you have learned the concepts involved in programming, you will find that picking up a new programming language is but a few days' work.
